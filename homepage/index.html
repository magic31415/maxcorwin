        <li class="newline"><a href="congress.html" class="bold">What happened under Trump?</a>:
          A website to see all the bills that have been enacted by the federal government since
          President Trump took office. Although this was originally intended to be a updated
          version of <a href="http://www.whatthefuckhasobamadonesofar.com">this website</a> to
          reflect the changes under the new president, I have started adding additional features
          such as insight on how both chambers of congress, as well as your representatives, voted
          on each bill. This project is just getting started and there will be many more features
          to come! Having said that, this is very much a work in progress, so not everything is
          working perfectly yet. The stack consists of Phoenix, Elixir, Postgres, and ReactJS. Most
          of the data comes from the
          <a href="https://projects.propublica.org/api-docs/congress-api/">ProPublica Congress API</a>,
          but the ability to get your district by your address comes from the
          <a href="https://developers.google.com/civic-information/">Google Civic Information API</a>.
